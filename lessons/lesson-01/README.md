# 1. Start a new React project with `create-react-app`

In this lesson, we start a new React project using `create-react-app`. This allows us to not have to worry about tooling like webpack, babel etc. Once installed, we'll remove some of the files we don't need, add some CSS for our project, so we're ready to get started.

## How to run this lesson?

To run this lesson, go to the root of the project, and run
