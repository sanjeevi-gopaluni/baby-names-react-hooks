## 1. Getting started with create-react-app, cleaning up the starter project, adding the CSS (normalize + base styles)

## 2. iterate through an Array with JSX and the Array.map() method

Introduction to JSX. Import the names from JS file, and map through to output each name

## 3. Break down the application in UI components by "Thinking in components"

Identify what components will be needed. draw rectangles over the app. Create and import the `NamesList` component

## 4. Manage local state in React with the useState hook.

Search component

## 5. Focus user input on load with the useRef and useEffect hooks

## 6. Share state between component by elevating it to a parent, pass down via props

We look at our component diagram again. The `search` value needs to be available for the Search component, but also the NamesList. We need to elevate that piece of state to their common parent (App.js) and pass the state down to both components via "props".

## 7. Filtering the list of names with the `Array.filter()` method.

## 8. Adding names to the shortlist with the useState hook update function

## 9. Reducing "prop drilling" in React with the Context API

## 10. Consuming context in React with the useContext hook.
